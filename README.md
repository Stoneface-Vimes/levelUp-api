An api server built in rails to service a react powered front end

The skeleton of this server was built by following this guide
<https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one>
It provides helper a method for converting responses into json objects and a method to return the proper error codes to the requesting server if an error does occur, very helpful.
